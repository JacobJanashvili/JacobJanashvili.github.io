# Movie Site
Simple movie app created with vanilla js and of course html and css

## What can you do in this site?
For now you can only view movie(or tv series) information, search for movie or tv series and watch trailers  

## Design
For design i drew inspiration from movie.ge and imovies.cc (just for the search bar design and responsive search-bar) 

## What api-s did i use?
For sliders i used swiper-js and for movies i used tmdb

## What do i plan to add?
Since tmdb api doesn't have full movies nor torrent links i want to add torrent links myself so you can download movies and i also want to add login and rating when i'll learn post request.
